- 👋 Hi, I’m @patrick-radulian
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end engineering, react, css, experimentation, xr, games, ux...
- 🌱 I’m currently (slowly) learning unreal engine 5, ever more react, and deepening my knowledge in Next.js...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally everything that's remotely interesting, preferably bleeding-edge stuff...
